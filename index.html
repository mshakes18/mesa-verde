    <p>What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man. No man at all. A crippled little rata. What a reputation to leave
      behind. Is
      that how you want to be remembered? Last chance to look at me, Hector.</p>

    <h3>Checking</h3>
    <p>I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late and he was
      high.
      He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement. I can't work with someone with poor judgement. I've been told,
      it's
      excellent.</p>

    <h3>Investing</h3>
    <p>You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion,
      so
      Walt's one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment.</p>
